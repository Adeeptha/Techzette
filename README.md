# Techzette
As the project for the Cloud Computing module in 4th semester, developed a cloud-based web application for users to buy laptops and computer accessories from various shops/companies in Techzette along with a function to build their PC from any of the above shops/companies. Also, users can sell their products by registering as individual sellers or a company.

There are 2 main sections in Techzette.

1. Laptops and Accessories.
Users can create their accounts and register with Techzette as a buyer or individual sellers. Buyers can buy laptops and other computer accessories from registered individual sellers while sellers can post their products.

1. Partners and PC build.
Users can also create their accounts through this section as buyers or partners(for tech companies) and to build their PC. This section allows users to build a PC with any computer part from any partner. Also, this section helps users to choose their favorite shop/company(partner) and buy products from them.

There are 2 payment methods.

1. Cash on delivery.
This method is for buyers who buy computer accessories.

2. Card Payments.
